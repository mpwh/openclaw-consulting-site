        <p class="text-neutral-400 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          OpenClaw is an open-source, self-hosted AI agent that goes far beyond simple chat.
          It operates around the clock, handling real work across every channel your business uses.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          It is not a chatbot. It is a digital assistant capable of genuine reasoning, complex
          workflows, and autonomous decision-making — running on <em>your</em> machine, with
          <em>your</em> data staying private.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-500 text-sm">
          Unlike ChatGPT, it doesn't wait to be asked. It works proactively in the background,
          sending briefings, monitoring signals, and automating tasks you'd otherwise do manually.
