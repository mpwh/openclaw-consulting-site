  {
    q: 'What exactly is OpenClaw?',
    a: 'OpenClaw is an open-source, self-hosted AI agent platform. It connects large language models (like Claude or GPT) to your messaging apps — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord — and gives them tools to take real actions: reading email, managing tasks, browsing the web, scheduling automations, and more. It\'s not a chatbot. It\'s an agent that works in the background.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need to be technical to use it?',
    a: 'No. That\'s exactly why you hire a consultant. I handle all technical implementation. After setup, you interact with your AI assistant through natural conversation on platforms you already use — Telegram, WhatsApp, or Discord. No terminal required.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is this different from ChatGPT or Copilot?',
    a: 'ChatGPT answers questions when you ask it. OpenClaw works proactively — it sends you a morning briefing before you ask, monitors competitors automatically, transcribes meetings without prompting. It also runs on your own machine, so your data doesn\'t leave your control.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is my data secure?',
    a: 'Yes. Self-hosted means OpenClaw runs on your machine — not on a vendor\'s cloud. Your emails, documents, and conversations aren\'t stored externally. I also help you configure tool permissions so your assistant only accesses what you\'re comfortable sharing.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does it cost to run after setup?',
    a: 'OpenClaw itself is free and open-source. The main ongoing cost is the AI model API (typically Anthropic/Claude). For an active executive, expect $20–80/month in API fees — less than a typical SaaS subscription, and far less than a human assistant.',
  },
